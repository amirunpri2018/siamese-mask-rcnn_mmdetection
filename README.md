# One-shot Instance Segmentation
**The details about how to run our code will be updated soon**

# Introduction
This is **pytorch** version of [siamese Mask-RCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11507) and we use [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) toolbox to finish it.

# Installation
Please follow the installation in **README_mmdetection.md** or the steps in mmdetection in github

# Citation
This project is based on [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) toolbox.

Thanks for their contributions
